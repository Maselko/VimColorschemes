# VimColorschemes
 My vim colorschemes

## Chester.vim
This colorscheme is a [chester-atom-syntax](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax) in vim. Most of the colors are copied but some were a bit optimised. It looks like onedark but more colourful.

## TeXdarktheme
This is a colorscheme which was made from darktheme of TeXshop application. However, I personally prefer when comments are bright rather than gray and darker background so, I have tweaked a bit to suit me more.
